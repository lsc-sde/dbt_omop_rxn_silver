          The date and time of the Measurement. (Some database systems don't have a datatype of time.
          To accomodate all temporal analyses, datatype datetime can be used (combining measurement_date and measurement_time)Relevant Forum Discussion
      - name: measurement_type_concept_id
        description: A foreign key to the predefined Concept in the Standardized Vocabularies reflecting the provenance from where the Measurement record was recorded.
      - name: operator_concept_id
        description: |
          A foreign key identifier to the predefined Concept in the Standardized Vocabularies reflecting the mathematical operator that is applied to the value_as_number.
          Operators are <, ≤, =, ≥, >.
      - name: value_as_number
        description: A Measurement result where the result is expressed as a numeric value.
      - name: value_as_concept_id
        description: A foreign key to a Measurement result represented as a Concept from the Standardized Vocabularies (e.g., positive/negative, present/absent, low/high, etc.).
      - name: unit_concept_id
        description: A foreign key to a Standard Concept ID of Measurement Units in the Standardized Vocabularies.
      - name: range_low
        description: The lower limit of the normal range of the Measurement result. The lower range is assumed to be of the same unit of measure as the Measurement value.
      - name: range_high
        description: The upper limit of the normal range of the Measurement. The upper range is assumed to be of the same unit of measure as the Measurement value.
      - name: provider_id
        description: A foreign key to the provider in the PROVIDER table who was responsible for initiating or obtaining the measurement.
